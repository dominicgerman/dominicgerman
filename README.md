### Hi, I'm Dominic

I'm a software developer and singer based in the greater Chicago area.

I work as an Application Programmer Analyst for Enterprise Applications at North Park University where I mostly write Python and SQL. I like [writing Go](https://dominicgerman.com/#backend-projects), [learning DevOps in my homelab](https://blog.dominicgerman.com?tag=homelab), and [singing choral music](https://www.google.com/search?q=best+choral+performance+dominic+german).
